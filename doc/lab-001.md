# Lab-001 - Build Static Website with s3 Bucket

[Home](../README.md) | [Sample Site](http://meetup.playground24.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com) | [AWS Console](https://devopsplayground.signin.aws.amazon.com/console) | lab-001 | [lab-002](lab-002.md) | [lab-003](lab-003.md) | [lab-004](lab-004.md)

## __Goal:__ Create a static website using s3 bucket
__AWS Services:__ S3 (Static Web hosting)

The purpose for this lab is to create a static website which will form the base for the later labs. During the lab you will create a S3 bucket and upload the files that you download from GitHub for this playground and upload them to the S3 bucket. You will then enable the S3 Static Web Hosting on the bucket, which will provide you with an endpoint from which you can continue the labs.

The diagram below shows the architecture for this lab. We will be only using the S3 service and placing some files with into a S3 bucket.

If you do not se S3 tab located on the LHS of the console simply type S3 into the search bar and then select S3

1. Create a new s3 Bucket - Click on create bucket.
    1. __Name and region__
        - __Name:__ `<your name>.playground24`
        - __Region:__ `US West (Oregon)`
        - __Copy settings from an existing bucket:__ Leave blank  
        - Click 'Create Bucket'
1. Upload files from folder `lab-001_website`
    1. __Select files__
        - (all files minus `css` folder)
        - Click 'Next'
    1. __Set Permissions__
        - Manage Group Permissions > Everyone (Read)/Make public
        - Click 'Next'
    1. __Set Properties__
        - Click 'Upload'
1. Create subfolder `css` using S3 web console
    1. Goto bucket `<your name>.playground24`
        - Click Create folder
        - __Name:__ `css`
        - Click 'Save'
    1. Upload remaining files from `css` folder same steps as 2.
        - Remember to set permissions `everyone (Read)`
1. Enable __Static website hosting__
    - Properties > Static website hosting
    - Select 'Use this bucket to host a Website'
    - __Index document:__ index.html
    - __Error document:__ error.html
    - Click 'Save'
1. Open the __Endpoint__ in a web browser.
   - `http://<your name>.playground24.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com`
   
   __Anyone seeing any errors please let the team know and they will be round to assist.
   
1. Lab End.

## Conclusion

During this lab you have created a S3 Bucket and understood settings permissions and how to set a bucket up for hosting a website.

## Notes

### Storage Tiers Use cases

- __Standard__ : Use this tier when the other tiers are unsuitable
- __Standard - IA__ : Use when files are not frequently access will be charge at a lower rate than standard.
- __Amazon Glacier__ : It primary use case is for backup. There is a standard 3-4 hour retrieval time. For

### endpoints

Main difference between endpoints is website supports:
- Only public readable content
- Error handling returns html as oppose to Well formatted XML
- Only GET and HEAD requests where as bucket
- No SSL support for Website hosting.
- Redirection is supported
