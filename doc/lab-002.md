# Lab-002 - Sharing resources between s3 Buckets

[Home](../README.md) | [Sample Site](http://static.meetup.ecs-digital.co.uk.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/index.html) | [AWS Console](https://devopsplayground.signin.aws.amazon.com/console) | [lab-001](lab-001.md) | lab-002 | [lab-003](lab-003.md) | [lab-004](lab-004.md)

## __Goal:__ Share resources from another s3 bucket with website from __Lab-001__.
__AWS Services:__ S3 (Static Web hosting, CORS)

### What is CORS?
Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), a mechanism that allows restricted resources (e.g. fonts) on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.

##### Same-Origin Policy
A web application security model concept where a web browser permits scripts contained in a first web page to access data in a second web page, but only if both web pages have the same origin. An origin is defined as a combination of `URI scheme`, `hostname`, and `port` number. This policy prevents a malicious script on one page from obtaining access to sensitive data on another web page through that page's Document Object Model.


### Lab

During this lab you will understand what CORS is and how to enable a static website in S3 to access content from another S3 bucket.

In a production environment you will come into scenarios where you need to share resources from multiple buckets using this S3 feature you will be able to achieve this.

1. Upload files from `cors.html, demo_text.html` folder `lab-002_website` to bucket `<your name>.playground11` your static website from __Lab-001__.
    1. __Select files__
        - (`cors.html, demo_text.txt`)
        - Click 'Next'
    1. __Set Permissions__
        - Manage Group Permissions > Everyone (Read)/Make public
        - Click 'Next'
    1. __Set Properties__
        - Accept defaults, click 'Upload'
     - Click 'Save'
1. Open the __Endpoint__ in a web browser.
   - `http://<your name>.playground11.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com`
1. With a web browser visit the static website from __Lab-001__ and click on the menu item 'CORS' the __RED__ text __"LAB NOT STARTED"__ should disappeared if not refresh the web page.
1. Click on the button __Get External Content__. Javascript code you edited at the start of this lab has now pull text from the file `demo_text`.

In order to understand CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) you need to create another bucket, which this lab will pull resources from.

1. Create a new s3 Bucket
    1. __Name and region__
        - __Name:__ `<your name>.cors.playground11`
        - __Region:__ `US West (Oregon)`
        - __Copy settings from an existing bucket:__ Leave blank  
        - Click 'Create Bucket'
1. Upload files from the folder `lab-002_cors\cors_bucket` to your new bucket `<your name>.cors.playground11`
    1. __Select files__
        - (`cors_demo_text.txt, index.html, error.html`)
        - Click 'Next'
    1. __Set Permissions__
        - Manage Group Permissions > Everyone (Read)/Make public
        - Click 'Next'
    1. __Set Properties__
        - Accept defaults, click 'Upload'
1. Enable __Staitic website hosting__
     - Properties > Static website hosting
1. Select 'Use this bucket to host a Website'
     - __Index document:__ index.html
     - __Error document:__ error.html
     - Click 'Save'
1. Open the __Endpoint__ in a web browser.
    - `http://<your name>.cors.playground11.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com`
1. Edit the file `lab-002_cors\cors.html` change the Javascript link again to the new link from the new S3 bucket website.
    - __REPLACE:__ `demo_text.txt`
    - __WITH:__ `http://<YOUR NAME>.cors.playground11.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cors_demo_text.txt`
    - __NOTE:__ `<YOUR NAME>` should be replaced with your bucket name. e.g.
    ```
    <script type="text/javascript">
    $(document).ready(function(){
        $("button").click(function(){
            $("#s3_cors").load("http://YOUR_NAME.cors.playground11.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cors_demo_text.txt");
        });
    });
    </script>
    ```
1. Upload file to bucket `<your name>.playground11`
1. Click on the button __Get External Content__. You will notice that nothing happens. If you Enable the Javascript console you notice in Safari the error:
    ```
    [Error] Origin http://meetup.playground11.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
    [Error] Failed to load resource: Origin http://meetup.playground11.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. (cors_demo_text.txt, line 0)
    [Error] XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://meetup.cors.playground11.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cors_demo_text.txt due to access control checks.
    ```
    This occurs because web browsers expect resources to be requested from the same domain. To resolve this issue AWS S3 has a feature called CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing) if you enable this feature this will allow the webpage to request the content from another bucket.
1. With bucket `<your name>.cors.playground11` enable CORS configuration, add a new policy.
    - Permissions > CORS configuration
    - __NOTE:__ Replace url in `<AllowedOrigin>` tag with your static website link from lab-001.
    ```
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <CORSConfiguration xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
    <CORSRule>
        <AllowedOrigin>http://<your name>.playground11.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com</AllowedOrigin>
        <AllowedMethod>GET</AllowedMethod>
        <MaxAgeSeconds>3000</MaxAgeSeconds>
        <AllowedHeader>Authorization</AllowedHeader>
    </CORSRule>
    </CORSConfiguration>
    ```
    - Click "Save"
1. Click on the button Get External Content. You will see __CORS Working....!__ now.
1. Lab End.

## Conclusion

During this lab we used simple Javascript to pull a stream of HTML into the page. We then created a new S3 bucket and enable Web Hosting for this bucket. We then updated the Javascript to pull the stream of HTML from the new S3 bucket. This __FAILED__ with a Cross-origin error which we could view from the web browser's console. To enable sharing of resources from different bucket we enabled __CORS__ feature on the S3 bucket that we wanted to share data from and added our website url into the CORS configuration.

## Notes
__S3 Data Consistency Model__
- Provides read-after-write consistency for PUTS of new objects in your S3 bucket in all regions with one caveat.
    - Caveat - if you make a HEAD or GET request to the key name (to find if the object exists) before creating the object, Amazon S3 provides eventual consistency for read-after-write.
- Amazon S3 offers eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES in all regions. This means there may be a small lag/delay as data is replicated, thus may result in an older version been returned.
    - You need to make sure your code allows for this.
